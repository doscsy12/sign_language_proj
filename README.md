## Setup
To install TensorFlow 2 Object Detection API, refer to the step-by-step guide [here](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#tensorflow-installation). I would suggest you follow the instructions to the word, especially the Environment Setup and the Protobuf Installation.
